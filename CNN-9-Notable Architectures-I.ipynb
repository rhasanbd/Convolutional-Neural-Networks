    "# Notable Convnet Architectures - I\n",
    "\n",
    "The design of modern convnet architectures derives from scientific intuition, mathematical insights, and uncompromising engineering efforts (a.k.a trial and error). However, one should not indulge into clueless engineering exercises just because of easy access to the LEGO playground of TensorFlow or PyTorch like libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://cse.unl.edu/~hasan/Pics/CNN_LEGO.png\" width=500, height=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While this playground is luring, performing uneducated trial and error using TensorFlow or PyTorch like libraries won't get us far towards designing better architectures. At best we will be able to implement an existing architecture, albeit without a scientific understanding. No matter whether we intend to implement simple architectures like LeNet-5 or very deep and complex architectures, our design choices must be guided by scientific and engineering principles. The best way to acquire this acumen is to understand the successful designs as well as poor designs that stalled advancement. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the current and next two notebooks we discuss some of the notable convnet architectures that were proposed between 2012 and 2017. All of these architectures were the dominant architectures for some period of time. While the practical significance of some architectures dwindled over time, some of them still holds a shining spot inspiring novel architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How did we select the notable architectures?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these architectures were submitted by academics and industry leaders to the **ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)**. The ILSVRC is an annual computer vision competition developed upon a subset of a publicly available computer vision dataset called ImageNet. Some of the architectures that we discuss were  winners or runners-up in the ImageNet competition. This competetion is regarded as a measure of progress on supervised learning in computer vision since 2010. We study the winning entries as well as other notable architectures to develop an understanding of the scientific and engineering efforts behind the success of deep convnets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ImageNet Dataset and Annual Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "ImageNet is a large dataset of annotated photographs intended for computer vision research. It was developed by a group of researchers led by Fei-Fei Li. The ImageNet challenge employed a subset 1 million RGB images (it's a subset from 14 million images) to train convnets. The size of the images are large with varying dimensions. Usually the images are resized to 256 x 256. There are 1000 distinct categories of objects. Some of the classes are really subtle, e.g., it includes 120 breeds of dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are broadly three \"objects classification\" tasks given in the ILSVRC competetion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image classification: Predict the classes of objects present in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single-object localization: Image classification + draw a bounding box around one example of each object present.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Object detection: Image classification + draw a bounding box around each object present.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our discussion we will focus on the architectures that performed well on the **image classification** task. To evaluate the performance of a model, we will use top-5 error rate, which is a measure of the number of test images for which the modelâ€™s top five predictions did not include the correct answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ImageNet annual competition, the top-5 error rate for image classification fell from over 26% to less than 2.3% in just six years. At the beginning of the ImageNet competition, i.e., during 2010 and 2011, the top-5 classification error was above 26%. The breakthrough moment came in 2012 with the AlexNet architecture, which reduced the error down to 16.4%. Thus our story will begin from 2012. Note that our story ends in 2017. Because the annual ImageNet competition is no longer held after 2017. It was moved to Kaggle.\n",

    "## A Delayed Triumph of Deep Convnets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why did it take so long (1998 - 2012) for the Convnets to take off? \n",
    "\n",
    "The LeNet-5 architecture was designed in 1998. It was a 5-layer convnet, whereas AlexNet has 8 layers. Since then, there is a trend to create deep convnets. From 2015 onwards typical layer size increased to 152. Why did it take more than a decade to create the first \"deep\" convnet?\n",
    "\n",
    "Four developments contributed to the avalanche that started in 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hardware\n",
    "- Large dataset\n",
    "- Algorithm\n",
    "- Engineering tricks\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural network accelerator technologies from 1990s were not powerful enough to train multi-channel deep convnets. The datasets were small. Algorithimic improvements such as weight initialization techniques, activation functions, SGD optimizers, regularization techniques were late coming. That's why during the era to 1990s and 2000s, machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine outperformed neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior 2012 the main trend in computer vision was to **manually engineer features**. Instead of learning features, they were handcrafted. Machine learning scientists were invested in designing novel feature functions. These functions would create useful representations of the raw data, which then was fed to a classifier (e.g., SVM) for decision making. The algorithmic development for automatically learning representations (features) took off since 2012. Thus, the journey of modern convnets could be considered as the evolution of the algorithmic and engineering efforts for **creating powerful representations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was observed that deeper convnets were able to learn complex representations. They use many convolution layers to learn expressive representations in a hierarchical fashion. Depth was the key. But deep networks that are created by stacking many conv layers make the learning infeasible due to the sheer size of the networks. Thus, much of the effort was invested designing novel techniques for reducing complexity of the networks. While some of these inventions were mathematically derived, most of these are accomplished via engineering tricks.\n",

    "We will discuss both the science and engineering of designing effective and efficient Convnets.\n",

    "Let's discuss some aspects of the AlexNet architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Larger Filter Size in the First Conv Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "AlexNet uses 11 x 11 filters in the first Conv layer because of the large size of the ImageNet images (largest image is 4288 x 2848, and average image size is  469 x 387). The ImageNet images are resized to 224 x 224, which is significantly larger than the 28 x 28 MNIST images. Thus objects in the ImageNet data spans across more pixels. To match this, a large Conv filter was required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Increased Expressive Capacity\n",
    "AlexNet uses significantly more filters in each layer as compared to LeNet, which increased its expressiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ensures Gradient Flow During Training via Backpropagation\n",
    "Alexnet uses ReLU activation function, which helps the training in deep networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combat Overfitting using Novel Regularization Techniques\n",
    "AlexNet uses two novel regularization techniques for reducing overfitting (model's complexity).\n",
    "- Dropout layer: AlexNet applied 50% dropout at the two FC hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image augmentation: Data was augmented by randomly shifting the training images by various offsets, flipping them horizontally, and changing the lighting conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improve Generalization through Novel Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "AlexNet applies a novel normalization step between the first two Conv layer, right after the ReLU activation. It's called the called **local response normalization (LRN)**. It is used to activate the most competetive neurons. It ensures that the most strongly activated neurons inhibit other neurons located at the same position in neighboring feature maps. This encourages different feature maps to specialize, pushing them apart and forcing them to explore a wider range of features, ultimately improving generalization. \n",

The NiN architecture advanced the feature extraction process by offering a technique to leverage **depth or channel** information. It used 1 x 1 Conv layers for extracting cross-channel information by adding per pixel nonlinearity.\n",

    "Szegedy's group explored the possibility of combining all of these feature extraction techniques. They combined larger Conv layers and Max Pool layer to scan the input map across spatial dimension, as well as 1 x 1 Conv layers to scan along the channel direction. A single input map is scanned by variously-size filters and Max Pool filter in parallel. Then, the output obtained from the parallel scanning paths are concatenated to create a single output. This block containing parallel combination of filters was named as the **inception** block. These blocks were stacked to create a new architecture, which was named as the GoogLeNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Szegedy et al. argued the need to design deeper networks for creating more expressive features. But the deeper the network gets, the more expensive it becomes both in terms of the space (number of parameters) and time (number of floating-point operations or FLOPS). Szegedy's group proposed an ingenuous solution to keep the number of GoogLeNet parameters was significantly smaller as well as reduce the FLOPS substantially. For example, AlexNet required 60 million parameters, whereas GoogLeNet used 6 million parameters.  \n",

    "## GoogLeNet: Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The Inception block-based GoogLeNet architecture is complex and requires careful engineering. To boost up its performance (effectiveness and efficiency), Google researchers employed a lot of tricks. The complexity of its Inception architecture makes it more difficult to make changes to the GoogLeNet architecture. If the architecture is scaled up naively, large parts of the computational gains can be immediately lost. The original paper does not clearly describe the contributing factors that lead to the various design decisions of the GoogLeNet architecture. For example, if we want to increase the capacity of the Inception blocks, we cannot just increase the number of filter bank sizes. Because it will lead to a significant increase in both computational cost and number of parameters. This makes it much harder to adapt it to new use-cases while maintaining its efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Inception-vXXX\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome the scaling problem of the GoogLeNet architecture, which is dubbed as Inception-v1, Google researchers kept on modifying the Inception architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The popular versions of the Inception-based networks are as follows.\n",
    "- Inception-v1 (GoogLeNet)\n",
    "- Inception-v2 and Inception-v3 (2015): presented in the same paper\n",
    "- Inception-v4 and Inception-ResNet (2016): presented in the same paper\n",
    "\n",
    "Each version is an iterative improvement over the previous one. Below we discuss the key changes made in Inception-v2 and v3. The Inception-v4 and Inception-ResNet improvements will be discussed later, after we present the ResNet architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What were the key design considerations for imroving the Inception-based networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational gains of the GoogLeNet architecture is mostly attributed to dimension reduction of the filters. This can be viewed as a special case of **factorizing convolutions in a computationally efficient manner**. For example, consider the case of a 1 x 1 Conv layer followed by a 3 x 3 Conv layer. In a vision network, it is expected that the outputs of nearby activations are highly correlated. Therefore, we can expect that their activations can be reduced before aggregation and that this should result in similarly expressive local representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next logical step would be to explore other ways of factorizing convolutions in various settings, especially in order to increase the computational efficiency of the solution. The benefit of suitable factorization is that it would lead to disentangled parameters and therefore with faster training. This gain in compute and memory can be leveraged to increase the filter-bank sizes of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Inception block was modified in the following three manners for scaling up convolution networks in efficient ways, as shown in the figure below. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inception Block a: For improving computational speed, 5 x 5 convolutions were factored into two 3 x 3 convolution operations. Convolutions with larger spatial filters (e.g. 5 Ã— 5 or 7 Ã— 7) tend to be disproportionally expensive in terms of computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Inception Block b: A cheaper factorization technique was used. For example, a 3 x 3 convolution is equivalent to first performing a 1 x 3 convolution, and then performing a 3 x 1 convolution on its output. This method is 33% more cheaper than the single 3 x 3 convolution. Thus, n x n convolutions were factored to a combination of 1 x n and n x 1 convolutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Inception Block c: For improving the representational bottleneck, the Inception block was made wider instead of deeper by expanding the filter banks. Reducing the dimensions too much may cause loss of information, known as a \"representational bottleneck\". The dimensionality of the maps provides a rough estimate of information content. Although information content cannot be assessed merely by the dimensionality of the representation as it discards important factors like correlation structure. If the module was made deeper instead, there would be excessive reduction in dimensions, and hence loss of information. It was argued that we should avoid bottlenecks with extreme compression. In general the representation size should gently decrease from the inputs to the outputs before reaching the final representation used for the task at hand. \n",

    "\n",
    "The output size of each module is the input size of the next one. Variations in reduction technique were used to reduce the grid sizes between the Inception blocks whenever applicable. Some convolutions are marked with 0-padding, which is used to maintain the grid size. 0-padding is also used inside those Inception blocks that do not reduce the grid size. All other layers do not use padding. \n",

    "## Inception-v3 (2015)\n",
    "\n",
    "The GoogLeNet introduced the notion of auxiliary classifiers to improve the convergence of very deep networks. The original motivation was to push useful gradients to the lower layers to make them immediately useful and improve the convergence during training by combating the vanishing gradient problem in very deep networks. However, it was found that auxiliary classifiers did not result in improved convergence early in the training. The training progression of network with and without side head looks virtually identical before both models reach high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was argued that the auxilary classifiers functioned as regularizes, especially if they had BatchNorm or Dropout operations. Thus, in Inception-v3, batch normalization was added in the auxillary Cclassifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07261.pdf\n",

    "- All of the above upgrades described for Inception-v2\n",
    "- RMSProp Optimizer\n",
    "- Factorized 7 x 7 convolutions\n",
    "- Label Smoothing: It's a type of regularizing component added to the loss formula that prevents the network from becoming too confident about a class. It prevents overfitting.\n",
