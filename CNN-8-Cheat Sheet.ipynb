    "# Convnet Cheat Sheet\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we do the following two tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a cheat sheet for convnets\n",
    "- Implement the LeNet5 architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the following general convnet architecture. We will state the expression for the number of learnable parameters and dimension of each layer.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Input Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically images are RGB and are large in size. Three types of processing are usually done on the input images.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Downscale the Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Large images are scaled to small sizes as they are expensive to process (need more RAM and parameters). Depending on the memory of CPU/GPU the scaling factor is determined. A preferred size for downscaling is 128 x 128. If space becomes an issue, we can downsample to 32 x 32.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Augment the Images\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce overfitting, training data are augmented by slighty \"distorting\" the image via spatial translation, rotation, adding noise, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardize the Images\n",
    "\n",
    "The Backpropagation algorithm for training convnets require us to standardize the images. One of the two techniques are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "        -- Standardization: transform the images to have zero mean and unit variance.\n",
    "        -- Scale (min-max scaling): transform the pixels to lie between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conv Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that the input image has $n_k$ channels with height and width: $n_h \\times n_w$. Then, a single filter will have $n_k$ channels. For a stride $s$, the dimension of a single filter is $f_h \\times f_w \\times n_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of these 3D filters $f_k$ is usually a power of 2. For example, we use filters 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size and width of the filters are typically odd numbers, such as 1 x 1, 3 x 3, or 5 x 5. Most common choices are 3 x 3 and 5 x 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 1 x 1 filters are used for a special purpose, which we will discuss later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of learnable parameters or weights in the first Conv layer is\n",
    "\n",
    "- $f_k \\times (f_h \\times f_w \\times n_k + 1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that each filter uses a bias weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every single filter creates a 2D feature map $Z$. For stride $s$ and $p$ number of padding layers, the size of the 2D feature map is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\frac{n_h +2p - f_h}{s} + 1 \\times \\frac{n_w + 2p - f_w}{s} + 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "When SAME padding is used, the value of $p$ is determined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "These give:\n",
    "$p = \\frac{f_h - 1}{2}$ or\n",
    "$\\frac{f_w - 1}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be a total of $f_k$ 2D feature maps, which are activated by passing through a nonlinear activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pool Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pooling layer takes the activated $f_k$ 2D feature maps and downsamples to the height and width as: \n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\frac{n_h - pool\\_size}{s} + 1 \\times \\frac{n_w - pool\\_size}{s} + 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "There will be $f_k$ such pooled maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## FC Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of learnable parameters or weights in an FC layer is\n",
    "\n",
    "- $(num\\_input\\_neurons + 1) \\times num\\_output\\_neurons $\n",
    "\n",
    "One bias neuron is added with the input layer of FC.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## How the Layer Size Changes in Deeper Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the type of padding and stride, the spatial resolution decreases via convolution.\n",
    "- Stride 1 & SAME padding: input map size doesn't decrease\n",
    "- Stride 1 & VALID padding: input map size decreases\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the type of padding and pooling widow size, the size of the feature maps decrease.\n",
    "- Generally a pooling layer with stride $s$ decreases the size of the maps by a factor of $s$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Filters within a layer must all be the same size, but sizes may vary with layer. Similarly for pooling, the stride may vary with layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general the number of convolutional filters increases with layers. As a consequence, as the depth of the convnet increases:\n",
    "- Spatial dimension of the layers (resolution of the maps) decreases\n",
    "- Depth of the layers (number of maps) increases\n",
    "\n",
    "This results into a pyramid structure, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://cse.unl.edu/~hasan/Pics/CNN_Pyramid.png\" width=600, height=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## LeNet-5\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put the above cheat sheet into perspective by mapping it onto the LeNet-5 architecture. We will build this convnet using TensorFlow, and use it to classify MNIST handwritten digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we stack a series of the fundamental convnet layers to create the LeNet-5 architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conv layer C1 (with activation): 6 filters of size 5 x 5, stride 1, SAME padding, tanh activation\n",

    "We passed single-channel (grayscale) 28 Ã— 28 pixels images through the network. Since we used the SAME padding in the first CONV layer with a stride of 1, the images were zero-padded by adding two layers of pixels on each side. Thus the input images that were fed to the network is 32 x 32.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the network does not use any padding, which is why the size keeps shrinking as the image progresses through the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "The network uses average pooling. However the average pooling layers are slightly more complex than usual: each neuron computes the mean of its inputs, then multiplies the result by a learnable coefficient (one per map) and adds a learnable bias term (again, one per map), then finally applies the activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most neurons in C3 maps are connected to neurons in only three or four S2 maps (instead of all six S2 maps).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the output layer is a bit special: instead of computing the matrix multiplication of the inputs and the weight vector, each neuron outputs the square of the Euclidian distance between its input vector and its weight vector. Each output measures how much the image belongs to a particular digit class. The cross-entropy cost function is now preferred, as it penalizes bad predictions much more, producing larger gradients and converging faster.\n",

    "## Larger Filters vs Smaller Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "What should be the size of the filters? Is it a good idea to use large filters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we answer this question, let's consider what is the issue with large filters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of parameters (weights) for a given layer's filter is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $(height (f_k) \\times width (f_w) \\times num\\_in\\_channels (n_k) + 1) \\times num\\_out\\_channels (f_k)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that the number of parameters increases significantly if both the input channels and output channels are large.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at two cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First Conv Layer: Typical to use large filters with stride > 1\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not uncommon to use large filters in the first Conv layer. For example, AlexNet uses 11 x 11 filter, GoogleNet uses 7 x 7 filter, LeNet-5 uses 5 x 5 filter. Since the number of input channels is small (3 channel for RGB images) and the number of filters (output channels) is comparatively smaller, we could afford to use large filters in the first layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also typically we use larger strides with large filters in the first layer. For example, AlexNet uses stride 4, GoogleNet uses stride 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Conv Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the number of input and output channels increases as we go into the deeper layers in convnets, using larger filters would increase both the number of parameters and amount of floating-point multiplications. Thus, instead of using larger filters, we could stack multiple smaller filters. It has multiple benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate this using an example. We simplify the analysis using equal number of input and output channels. Let's denote it with C.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single layer with a 5 x 5 filter: parameters = $5 \\times  5 \\times  C \\times C = 25C^2$\n",
    "- A stack of two layers each with 3 x 3 filters: parameters = $2(3 \\times  3 \\times  C \\times C) = 18C^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we see that stacking multiple smaller layers will use fewer parameters and require fewer computations. Also, a stack of two 3 x 3 Conv (stride 1) layers has **same effective receptive field** as one 5 x 5 conv layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit is, if we stack $n$ smaller filters instead of a single large filter, each of those smaller filters will have their own nonlinear activation layers. It means that instead of a single activation layer now the signal will pass through three activation layers. As a consequence the decision function will be more discriminative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, relacing a larger filter with a stack of smaller filters (with incorporated noninearity) results into imposing a regularization on the larger filter. Because now we force the larger filter to have a decomposition through the smaller filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, it is preferred to use 3 x 3 filters in the Conv layers except in the first Conv layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can we use even smaller filters, such as 1 x 1? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## When should we use 1 x 1 filters?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution using 1 x 1 filters does not seem to be useful. Because convolution is all about computing the correlation of the nearby pixels. The goal is to identify spatial features, which requires filters larger than 1 x 1. Yet so 1 x 1 filters are pretty useful. But how?\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 x 1 filters are used to reduce the number of output channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this, consider the following figure. The input map has 3 channels and we convolve it with two filters (yellow and green). Each input channel of a single filter multiplies the corresponding pixel value, then add it to create a single value on the output map. The 3 x 3 input map has 9 positions. A 1 x 1 filter scans through each position and maps to 9 positions on the output map. Thus, the height and width of the input map don't change at the output. What changes is the number of output maps. Since we used two filters, the number of output maps is two. \n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://cse.unl.edu/~hasan/Pics/CNN_1_by_1_filters-1.png\" width=600, height=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we have an input map with 20 channels. We can shrink the channels by convolving with 1 x 1 filters. If we need to create only 2 output maps, then we perform convolution with two 1 x 1 filters, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://cse.unl.edu/~hasan/Pics/CNN_1_by_1_filters-2.png\" width=600, height=300>\n",
    "\n",

    "The 1 Ã— 1 Conv layer can be considered as constituting a fully-connected layer applied at every single pixel location to transform the corresponding $n_k$ (input channels) input values into $f_k$ (output channels) output values. The weights of the 1 x 1 Conv layer is tied across pixel location. Thus the 1 Ã— 1 Conv layer requires $n_k \\times f_k$ weights (and the bias term)."
