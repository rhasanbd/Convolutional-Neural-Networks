# Convolutional Neural Networks

If github in unable to render a Jupyter notebook, copy the link of the notebook and enter into the nbviewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

These notebooks provide an introduction to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

- Notebook 1: Motivation, CNN architecture, Fully-Connected (FC) Networks vs CNNs, Biological origin, CNN layers, CNN formalization

- Notebook 2: Convolution: Nuts & Bolts - I: Convolution operation, Single channel & multi-channel input, and multiple filters, Mathematical definition of convolution

- Notebook 3: Convolution: Nuts & Bolts - II: 
  
    -- Handcraft edge detector filters
    
    -- Edge detection in a single-channel image using a single filter
    
    -- Define a convolution function for multi-channel image using and multiple filters
    
    -- Edge detection in a multi-channel image using multiple filters
    
    -- Edge detection using TensorFlow's convolution function
