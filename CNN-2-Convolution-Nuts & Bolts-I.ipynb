    "# Convolution: Nuts & Bolts - I\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we discuss the nuts and bolts of the convolution operation in the context of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or convnets. We try to understand how convnets use the convolution operation to solve perception tasks such as vision. \n",
    "\n",
    "Convnets are designed based on the architecture of visual cortex. The **visual world is fundamentally spatially hierarchical**. Thus, to percieve an input image convnets create successive layers of representations of the image. Convnets employ convolutional filters (also known as kernels) that scan across the image for detecting local features, thus create feature maps. These feature maps are then scanned by filters in the successive layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first convolution layer learns small local patterns such as edges, the second convolution layer learns larger patterns made of the features of the first layers, and so on. This allows convnets to efficiently learn increasingly complex and abstract visual concepts. The final layer of a convnet uses high-level representations to extract class-level information (e.g., whether the image represents a cat), as shown below.\n",

    "\n",
    "The fundamental technique for detecting local features (from the input image or the subsequent feature maps) is the convolution operation. But what is convolution?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convolution: Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have an intuitive understanding of convolution. Consider the following image.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://cse.unl.edu/~hasan/Pics/CNN_Image_Original.png\" width=300, height=100>\n",
    "\n",
    "The image shows the face of the person in granular detail. Say that we want to squash the details and create a smoother version of it as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://cse.unl.edu/~hasan/Pics/CNN_Image_Smoothed.png\" width=300, height=100>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we do this smoothing operation? \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a simple approach. Replace each pixel by the average value of its surrounding pixels. For example, we can take all pixels within one-pixel neighborhood of a given pixel, compute their mean, and replace the given pixel by the mean. Then, we get a new image with somoothed out pixel values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the above approach, we can use a fixed-size window to slide over all regions of the image and compute the mean of the overlap region. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an illustration of this implementation, let's say that we have a 4 x 4 image (on the left below) that we want to smooth out. The pixel values for each cell are shown. We slide a 3 x 3 window from left to right and top to bottom. At each step of the slide, the 3 x 3 window is set on a cell (e.g., the top-left cell) that we want to smooth out. Then, the 9 values in the overlap region are averaged (i.e., 2.25). This new value replaces the old pixel value (e.g., top-left pixel on the right). This way we create a smoothed out version of the original \"image\" on the right.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://cse.unl.edu/~hasan/Pics/CNN_Smoothing.png\" width=600, height=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation of sliding a fixed-size window over the image and to compute new values for the overlap region resembles the convolution operation. The sliding window is known as convolution filter or kernel. The output is known as feature map. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convolution: in Convnets\n",
    "\n",
    "Convnets use the convolution operation (very similar to the above-mentioned smoothing operation) to detect local features. What exatly are these local features?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following image.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://cse.unl.edu/~hasan/Pics/CNN_Image_Bench.png\" width=300, height=100>\n",
    "\n",
    "This image consists of a set of distinctive vertical and horizontal lines. For perceiving this image, first, we need to detect the vertical and horizontal \"edges\", which are low-level features. Then, these features are assembled to construct the complete perception of the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "A convnets starts with detecting the low-level features (i.e., edges) via the convolution operation. Following figure shows the output (feature map) created by two convolutional filters: one for vertical edge detection and other for horizontal edge detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://cse.unl.edu/~hasan/Pics/CNN_Image_Bench_Edges.png\" width=600, height=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, convolution operation is a fundamental technique in convnets to detect local features of an image. But how do we design these filters?\n",
    "\n",
    "We actually don't! In a convnet we only create an architecture for these filters (size, number, layer). A convnet **learns** these filters via **Backpropagation** algorithm for detecting features suitable for the target task (e.g., classification).\n",

    "## Convolution: Mathematical Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution is a special type of **linear operation**. In general, it's an operation on two functions of a real-valued argument. We re-use the smoothing example to present a mathematical definition of convolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Convolution: Continuous Input Function - 1D Case\n",
    "\n",
    "We simplify the problem by considering a one-dimensional function. Say that we want to smooth out a one-dimensional function x(t). Here \"t\" denotes the location in 1D space.\n",
    "\n",
    "To smooth x(t), we replace each point on x(t) by the average value of its neighborhood. When we do this averaging, we want to give more weight to the nearest values. In other words, we want to compute a **weighted average** that gives more weight to nearest values. We can do this by using a weighting function w(). \n",
    "\n",
    "If we apply such a weighted average operation at the current location of the function x() (by multiplying x with w), we obtain a new function z() that provides a smoothed estimate of x().\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically speaking, we want to get the weighted average of x() at the current location \"i\". This average is denoted by z(i). We look at the neighborhood of x from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$. We denote the range with \"t\".\n",
    "\n",
    "$z(i) = \\int_{t = -\\infty}^{+\\infty} x(t)w(i - t)dt$\n",
    "\n",
    "This **weighted averaging operation operation is called convolution**. The convolution operation is typically denoted with an asterisk.\n",
    "\n",
    "$z(t) = (x ∗ w)(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in this example, \"w\" needs to be a valid probability density function, or the output is not a weighted average.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the convnet terminology, the first argument (the function x) to the convolution is often referred to as the input and the second argument (the function w) as the kernel or filter. The output is referred to as the feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example of convolution is based on a continuous function of continuously varying position \"t\". In convnets, positions are discretized. Thus, we are interested about discrete convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discrete Convolution: 1D Case\n",
    "\n",
    "In discrete convolution, the position index \"t\" can take on only integer values. If we now assume that x and w are defined only on integer t, we can define the discrete convolution as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$z(i) = \\sum_{t = -\\infty}^{+\\infty} x(t)w(i - t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In convnets, the input is usually a multidimensional array of data (e.g., 3D RGB image) and the kernel is usually a multidimensional array of parameters that are adapted by the learning algorithm. These multidimensional arrays are typically represented by tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multidimensional Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that to implement convolution in covnets, we need to explicitly store each element of the input and kernel separately. Thus, we usually assume that these functions are zero everywhere except for the finite set of points for which we store the values. This means that in practice we can implement the infinite summation as a summation over a finite number of array elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define the equation for multidimensional convolution, we first consider the 2D case. More specifically, we use a single-channel 2D image as input and a single 2D kernel as filter, which produces a 2D feature map. After understanding the 2D case, we will define the convolution equation for multi-channel and multi-filter case.\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider a single-channel 2D image $X$ where $X(a, b)$ is the pixel intensity at x-y coordinates denoted by a,b. Since the input has two dimensions, we want to apply convolution over these two axes at a time. Thus, we need to use a single 2D kernel $K$. We get a new image (feature map) denoted by $Z$ by performing 2D convolution as follows.\n",

    "\n",
    "It appears that if we try to implement convolution according to the above definition, then we will have to **flip the kernel matrix**. Many neural network libraries don't implement the kernel-flipping version of convolution. Instead they use a straight-forward technique. Their technique is known as **cross-correlation**, which is the same as convolution but without flipping the kernel.\n",

In convnets, a convolutional layer cross-correlates the input and filter (kernel) and adds a scalar bias to produce an output (feature map). We will refer to the cross-correlation operation as convolution to conform with the convention in Deep Learning literature.\n",
